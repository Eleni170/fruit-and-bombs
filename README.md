# fruit-and-bombs
Collect fruit and avoid bombs for as long as possible.

This repository includes a game called fruit and bombs, which is about collecting fruit and avoiding bombs that fall from the sky for as long as the player can.

The game starts with a player put in a 2d space. Every time he collects a fruit he gets points and the game becomes harder, as the objects start to drop faster. When the player misses a fruit he loses points and when he collides with a bomb he loses a life. The game stops when the player has lost all 3 lives.

The game is written in Python, using a library called [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). Pygame includes functionalities for adding background images and sound.
